## What Is This?

`v0-chat-mode` is a custom agent mode for GitHub Copilot that replicates the intelligent code generation, styling conventions, and Next.js best practices from **Vercel's v0** product. Instead of toggling between the v0 web interface and your code editor, you get v0's capabilities directly in VS Code through GitHub Copilot's Agent Mode.

### Why Use This?

- **No API Dependencies**: Generate v0-quality code without calling v0 or AI SDK APIs
- **Zero Context Switching**: Stay in your editor—no copying and pasting from web UIs
- **Visual-to-Code**: Paste screenshots, wireframes, or design mockups directly in chat to generate matching implementations
- **Production-Grade Code**: Get the same high-quality, modern Next.js patterns that v0 produces
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Build complete features with natural language prompts
- **Full Customization**: Extend or modify the agent mode to fit your workflow
