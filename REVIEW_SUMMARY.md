## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this configuration ready for production use?**  
A: Yes, with the critical fixes applied (formatting, versions, terminal clarification). The additions we've made (error handling, security, testing) make it even stronger.

**Q: What's the most critical improvement needed?**  
A: Security guidelines and error handling were missing entirely. These are now addressed in the new sections we've added.

**Q: How long will it take to implement all recommendations?**  
A: Priority 1 items: ~6 hours. Priority 1-2 combined: ~21 hours. Full implementation: ~40 hours spread over 6 weeks.

**Q: Can I use the new sections immediately?**  
A: Yes! The error handling, security, testing, and performance sections are ready to use as-is. Copy them into your v0.chatmode.md file.

**Q: Will these changes break existing functionality?**  
A: No. These are additive changes that enhance existing guidelines. They don't modify core tool definitions or existing patterns.
